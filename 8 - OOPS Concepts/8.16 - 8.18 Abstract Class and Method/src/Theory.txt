Abstract Methods:
	- Methods declared not defined
	public abstract void login();		// when you only know the method signature, but not the implementation
	
Abstract Class:
	- Abstract Methods can only be declared, not defined
	- In abstract class, you can have both abstract methods and normal methods.
	- You cannot create objects of abstract class
	- Abstract class need not have any abstract method.
	- But if a class has abstract methods, it should be abstract.
	
Old usages:
	- Example1: When you only know the signature of a method but don't know the implementation, and want it to be implemented later
	- Example2: When you have to pass object of a common type to a method and want to avoid code duplicacy.
