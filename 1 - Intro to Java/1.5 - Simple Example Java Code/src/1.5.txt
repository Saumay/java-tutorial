Important Question: What is the need of public static void keywords in Java?
Answer:
# void -> does not return anything
# static -> If it was non-static, object was needed to be created first. But Old function should be the first piece of code to run in Java Application.
# public -> to access main method from anywhere. Wherever main method is present, it should be accessible by JVM
