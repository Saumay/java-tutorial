.class -> secure
Can't be read through normal editors

javac filename.java
java Classname

For a public class, class and filename should be same.
Reason:	Since, public class can be accessed by anyone and from anywhere, compiler would have to search all the .java files in file system for searching that public class.
		On the other hand, if filename is same as class name, it's easier for compiler to search that file.

We can't have more than 1 public class in same .java source file.
Reason: You can't name file with any one class name then. Compilation Error
