In Java, there are both Errors and Exceptions

Types of statements:
	1) Normal Statement
		int i=1;
	2) Critical Statement
		int i = j/k;
		
Exception Handling:
	- All the names ending with 'able' are interfaces, except Throwable, which is a class.
	- Critical statements should always be written inside try block
