Both implement List interface
Both provides same functionalities

ArrayList
    - Dynamic Array
    - capacity is increased by 50% once current capacity is reached
    - searching is efficient
    - insertion and deletion is not efficient

LinkedList
    - Double linked list
    - no fixed capacity
    - insertion and deletion is efficient
    - searching is not efficient

Better choice: depends on requirement
    - If search operations are more, use ArrayList
    - If addition deletion operations in middle are more, use LinkedList
