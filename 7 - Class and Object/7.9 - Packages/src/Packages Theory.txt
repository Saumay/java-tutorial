Packages: for better management of classes(similar to organizing files in pc)

Generally, package is named after domain name since domain name is unique
Ex:
	Domain name:  telusko.com
	Package name: com.telusko (to keep it unique)
	
	com->telusko->test
	
import com.telusko.* will fetch all the classes inside telusko package but not the classes present inside test package(nested classes are not fetched)

We can't create classes with same names in same package
We can create classes with same names in different package
